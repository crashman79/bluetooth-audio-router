# PipeWire Audio Tools

A collection of utilities for PipeWire/PulseAudio audio management on Linux.

## Projects

### [Audio Router](./audio-router/)
Automatic audio stream routing based on application type and connected devices. Routes applications to specific audio outputs (Bluetooth headsets, USB speakers, HDMI, etc.) automatically.

**Status**: ✅ Production-ready

## Quick Start

```bash
cd audio-router
./install.sh
systemctl --user start pipewire-router
systemctl --user enable pipewire-router
```
